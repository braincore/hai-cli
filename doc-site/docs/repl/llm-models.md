# LLM models

`hai` supports models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, xAI, and
Ollama.

## Default model

The default model is the active model when a new instance of `hai` is launched.

Select a default model with:

```
/ai-default <model>
```

This writes to your `hai.toml` [config](../config.md#default-ai-model) which
can also be changed manually:

```toml
default_ai_model = "gpt-5"
```

If a default model isn't set, it's automatically chosen based on API key
availability.

## Switching models

Switching is as easy as:

```
/ai <model>
```

Models can even be switched mid-conversation as long as the target model
supports all the capabilities (images, tools) utilized in the conversation.
