# Getting help

## Help menus

### Command-line help

The `--help` flag shows the options available for the `hai` program:

```console
$ hai --help
```

### REPL help

The `/help` command shows the commands available in the `hai` REPL:

```console
[0] /help
```

### Help task

The AI can assist you conversationally. Just use the `hai/help` task to load
the necessary context:

```console
[0] /task hai/help
```

## Viewing the version

When seeking help, it's important to determine the version of uv that you're using â€” sometimes the problem is already solved in a newer version.

To check the installed version:

```console
$ hai --version
```
