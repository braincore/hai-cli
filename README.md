> I got tired of opening up browser windows to chat with AIs.

- Run `hai` and immediately drop into an AI conversation prompt.
- Run `hai` in as many terminals as you'd like to have multiple simultaneous
  conversations.
- Start a new conversation with `/new` (`/n` for short).
  - Keep loaded files/assets/urls with `/reset` (`/r/`).

### Multi-AI

> I wasn't using the right AI for the right job because it was too annoying to
> switch around.

![](doc/hai-multi-ai.gif)

- `/ai <model>` - Switch with one command (tab-completion and abbreviations
  supported)
- Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, xAI, and local Ollama
  models


| Provider   | Notable Models (Not Comprehensive)      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| OpenAI     | gpt-4.1 (`41`), gpt-4.1-mini (`41m`), gpt-4.1-nano (`41n`), chatgpt-4o, gpt-4o (`4o`), gpt-4o-mini (`4om`) |
|            | o4-mini (`o4m`), o3, o3-mini (`o3m`), o1, o1-mini (`o1m`) |
| Anthropic  | sonnet-4 (`sonnet`), sonnet-4-thinking (`sonnet-thinking`), opus-4 (`opus`), opus-4-thinking (`opus-thinking`), haiku-3.5 (`haiku`) |
| Google     | gemini-2.5-flash (`flash25`), gemini-2.5-pro (`gemini25pro`), gemini-2.0-flash (`flash20`) |
| DeepSeek   | deepseek-reasoner (`r1`), deepseek-chat (`v3`) |
| xAI        | grok-4                                         |
| Ollama     | gemma3, llama3.2, llama3.3                     |

If a model doesn‚Äôt have a built-in shortcut, or if you want to use a specific
version, you can specify it as `<ai_provider>/<official_model_name>`.

#### Switch mid conversation

```
[0] How many "r"s in strawberry?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
There are two 'r's in the word "strawberry."
```
```
[2]: /ai o4-mini
Using AI Model: o4-mini
```
```
[2]: you're smarter than that
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
You‚Äôre right‚Äîmy mistake. ‚ÄúStrawberry‚Äù has three ‚Äúr‚Äùs: s¬†t¬†r¬†a¬†w¬†b¬†e¬†r¬†r¬†y.
```

#### Authenticating with AI Providers

You have two options:

1. Set an API key for each AI provider you plan to use.
    - via config: `~/.hai/hai.toml`
    - via CLI: `$ hai set-key <provider> <key>`
    - via REPL: `/set-key <provider> <key>`
2. Activate `hai router`: `/hai-router on`
    - Requires a subscription: `/account-subscribe`
    - Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, xAI‚Äîno API keys
      or extra setup needed‚Äîjust log in.
    - An easy way to support the hai project and its ongoing experimentation.

#### Incognito

> I wasn't asking all the crazy-person questions I wanted to.

![](doc/hai-incognito.gif)

- Run `hai --incognito` (`hai -i` for short).
- Local conversation history isn't saved.
- Since AI Providers keep logs of your conversations, consider configuring a
  local ollama setup in `~/.hai/hai.toml` and set `default_incognito_ai_model`
  (e.g. `ollama/gemma3:27b`).

### Tasks

> I often need to setup the same conversation context repeatedly.

> I got tired of sending AI prompt-pasta to friends and coworkers.

A *task* in hai is a prompt-on-steroids that can be:

1. Published publicly: `/task-publish <path>`
2. Executed by anyone using the task repo: `/task <username>/<task_name>`
3. Or, executed from a file: `/task <path>` (must start with `./`, `/`, or `~`)

A *task* is made up of steps: a sequence of repl-commands. The commands are the
same as the ones you use. A step can:

- Provide context
- Load resources (file, image, asset, URL)
- Execute local commands
- Prompt the user with a question
- Prompt the AI
- Cache local commands, prompt responses, and answers-to-questions.

Tasks make sharing workflows easy and improve their reproducibility given the
non-deterministic nature of LLMs.

Here's [`ken/pelican-bicycle`](https://hai.superego.ai/task/ken/pelican-bicycle):

```toml
name = "ken/pelican-bicycle"
version = "2.0.0"

description = "Runs simonw's \"Pelicans on a bicycle\" test"

steps = [
    """/pin The test is simple: Ask an AI to draw a pelican on a bicycle.

    https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle
    """,
    "/pin Checking what image tools you have",
    "/exec cairosvg --version",
    "/exec convert -version",
    "!sh Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle and pipe it into `cairosvg` or `convert` and output a png named `pelican-bicycle.png`",
    "/load pelican-bicycle.png",
    "/prompt Describe this image in one sentence."
]
```

![](doc/hai-pelican.gif)

#### Trusting a task

Some task steps require user confirmation because of the danger they pose (see
[Security Warning](#security-warning)). To skip these confirmations, you can
set the `trust` option to true: `/task(trust=true)` or `/task(trust)`

### !Tools

> I got tired of being the people-person between the AI and my terminal.

![](doc/hai-tool.gif)

`!sh <prompt>` - Ask the AI to execute shell commands directly.

```
[0]: /exec ls ~/.hai
```
```
data.db
data.db-shm
data.db-wal
hai.toml
```
```
[2]: !sh list tables
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
sqlite3 ~/.hai/data.db ".tables"
‚öô ‚öô ‚öô
account          asset            task_step_cache
ask_cache        misc
```

If I feel like being a manager I provide valuable oversight with `!?sh`

```
[0]: !?sh delete evidence.txt
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
rm evidence.txt
‚öô ‚öô ‚öô
[QUESTION] Execute? y/[n]:
```

To let the AI to decide whether to use your suggested tool, add a "?" as a suffix to the tool‚Äôs name.

```
[0]: !sh? how old is the earth?
```

```
The Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old.
```

#### Other tools

| Tool                  | Description                                             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `!py`                 | Run Python code.                                        |
| `!pyuv`               | Run Python code using `uv`.                             |
| `!html`               | Show HTML/CSS/JS in default browser.                    |
| `!clip`               | Copy something to your system clipboard.                |
| `!'<cmd>'`            | Run any program that accepts input via stdin.           |
| `!'<cmd>..{file}..'`  | Run any program with the AI populating a temp file.     |
| `!!<cmd>`             | Not a tool, but a shorthand for `/exec`.                |

For the last tool using the `{file}` placeholder, a file extension can be
specified (e.g. `{file.<ext>}`) to force the temporary file to have a
particular extension, which also enables syntax highlighting. This is helpful
for programs like `uv` that require a `.py` extension for Python scripts.

```
# Uses stdin (-)
[0]: !'uv run --with geopy -' distance from sf to nyc

OR

# Uses temporary file
[0]: !'uv run --with geopy {file.py}' distance from sf to nyc
```

```python
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

from geopy.distance import geodesic

sf_coords = (37.7749, -122.4194)  # San Francisco coordinates
nyc_coords = (40.7128, -74.0060)   # New York City coordinates

distance = geodesic(sf_coords, nyc_coords).miles
print(distance)

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

2571.9457567914133
```

The above uses `uv` only for demonstration purposes. There's a dedicated
`!pyuv` tool which instructs the AI to specify its dependencies and have them
be installed by `uv` automatically:

```
[0]: !pyuv distance from sf to nyc
```

```python
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

# /// script
# dependencies = ["geopy"]
# ///
from geopy.distance import geodesic

# Coordinates: (lat, lon)
sf = (37.7749, -122.4194)
nyc = (40.7128, -74.0060)

distance_km = geodesic(sf, nyc).kilometers
distance_miles = geodesic(sf, nyc).miles

print(f"Distance from San Francisco to New York City: {distance_km:.2f} km ({distance_miles:.2f} miles)")

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Distance from San Francisco to New York City: 4139.15 km (2571.95 miles)
```


Requires [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to be installed.

### Assets [Experimental]

> I'm tired of SaaS data silos being the biggest impediment to feeding my data
> to AIs the way I want.

Assets are objects stored in the cloud for your direct and indirect use via AIs.

- `/asset <name>` - Open/create asset in editor (`/a` shorthand)
  - Default editor is `vim`.
  - Override with `default_editor` in `~/.hai/hai.toml`
    - e.g. VS Code `code --new-window --disable-workspace-trust --wait`
  - `/a <name> [<editor>]` to override in the command 
- `/asset-view <name>` - Add an asset to the conversation for the AI to use.
- `/asset-load <name>` - Mimics `/load`, but for assets. Unlike `/asset-view`,
  the contents aren‚Äôt printed, and they are retained even after a `/reset`.
- `/asset-temp <name> [<count>]` - Downloads the asset to a temporary file and
  adds the file path to the conversation. This is a convenient way for the AI
  to access assets by path especially when using tools. If `count` is set, that
  number of revisions of an asset is written to files.
- `/asset-sync-down <prefix> <path>` - Syncs all assets with the given prefix
  to a local path.
  - Does not re-download assets that already exist locally.
  - Does not add info to the conversation. You will need to inform the AI of
    relevant files in the conversation typically by calling `!!ls <path>`.
  - Syncs asset metadata (if available) as the asset name with `.metadata`
    appended.
- `/asset-link <name>` - Generate a link to an asset (valid for 24 hours).
- `/asset-revisions <name> [<count>]` - Iterate through every revision of an asset.
- `/asset-import <name> <path>` - Import asset from a local file.
- `/asset-export <name> <path>` - Export asset to a local file.

Asset names can mimic file paths with slashes.

| üôã **Help Wanted** |
|-------------------|
| Interested in writing a query language (ala LINQ or SQL) for assets? |
| All ideas welcome. Please reach out or open an issue. |

#### Public

Public assets start with a frontslash followed by your username (`/<username>`):

- Here's how user `ken` creates a public file: `/asset /ken/public.txt`
- Anyone can see it with: `/asset-view /ken/public.txt`
- Here's how user `ken` creates a private file: `/asset private.txt`

You can also use `//` as a shortcut to refer to your own public asset path.
For example, if you are user `ken`, the command `/asset //public.txt` is
equivalent to `/asset /ken/public.txt`. This makes it easier to access your
public assets and lets you write task steps that are generic to the logged-in
account.

#### Search

Assets can be listed by prefix:

```
/asset-list todo_docs/2025-
# OR use /ls as shorthand
/ls todo_docs/2025-
```

Or, they can be searched semantically:

```
/asset-search cooking salmon
```

#### Using with shell

When running a shell command, use `@name` to reference an asset. The asset will
be transparently downloaded.

```
[0] !!cat @/hai/changelog | grep -A 2 v1.3.0
equivalent to:
[0] !!grep -A 2 v1.3.0 @/hai/changelog
```
```
## v1.3.0

- Add syntax highlighting for code blocks.
```

Note: `!!` is shorthand for `/exec`.

If a shell redirects (`>` or `>>`) to an @asset, the output file will be
uploaded as well.

```
[0] !!grep -A 2 v1.3.0 @/hai/changelog > @changes-v1.3.0
```

This processes a public asset from the `hai` account and saves a filtered
version to the `changes-v1.3.0` private asset.

**Limitations:** The implementation uses simple string substitution to replace
`@asset` markers with temporary files. Complex shell operations involving
quotes or escapes around asset references may not work as expected.

#### Conflicts

When the same asset is modified simultaneously by two separate `hai` processes,
a conflict occurs. The version that loses the race will be preserved as a
new asset with the same name as the original but with a random suffix.

## Advanced Usage

See all client commands with `/help` (`/h`).

### Account(s) management

- `/account` - See your current account
- `/account-new` - Create a new account
- `/account-login` - Login to an account
- `/account <username>` - Switch account
- `/account-subscribe` - Subscribe to support the project
- `/account-balance` - See AI credits remaining

### More on tools

Nothing makes me more secure as a human than the neverending mistakes AI makes
when using tools. Use a lone `!` to repeat the previous tool command & prompt.
Often, the AI will read the error message and fix itself:

```
[0]: !sh what's the weather in santa clara, ca
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

curl -s 'wttr.in/Santa+Clara,CA?format=%C+%t'

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Unknown location; please try ~37.2333253,-121.6846349
```
```
[3]: !
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

curl -s 'wttr.in/Santa+Clara?format=%C+%t'

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Partly cloudy +51¬∞F
```

Or, if you need to change your prompt while using the same tool, use
`! <prompt>` (note that `sh` is omitted):

```
[6]: ! how about tokyo?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

curl -s 'wttr.in/Tokyo?format=%C+%t'

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Clear +59¬∞F
```

### Tool mode

If you find yourself using the same tool over-and-over, you can enter tool-mode
by specifying a tool without a prompt (e.g. `!sh`).

```
[0]: !sh
```
```
Entering tool mode; All messages are treated as prompts for !sh. Use `!exit` when done
```
```
[0] !sh: what's the weather in alexandria, egypt?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

curl -s 'http://wttr.in/Alexandria?format=%C+%t+%w'

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Clear +77¬∞F ‚Üô11mph
```

A more realistic example is when using `hai` with `psql` (postgres client) to
avoid typing in the connection string each time (Note the location of the
semicolon `:`).

```
[0]: !'psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U ken -d grapdb_1'
```
```
Entering tool mode; All messages are treated as prompts for !'psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U ken -d grapdb_1'. Use `!exit` when done
```
```
[3] !'psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U ken -d grapdb_1': what db users are there?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

SELECT usename FROM pg_user;

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

 usename
---------
 ken
```
```
[5] !'psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U ken -d grapdb_1': is query logging turned on?

‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

SHOW logging_collector;

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

 logging_collector
-------------------
 off
```

When publishing tasks, you can place users directly into tool-mode by making it
the final command in your task's command list. This approach is helpful when
writing tasks for less technical folks.

Lastly, variables can come in handy:

```
[11]: /setvar db psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U ken -d grapdb_1
```
```
[12]: !'$db' what version is the db?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

SELECT version();

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô
...
```

### For general software development

Use `/load <path>` (`/l <path>`) to load files (e.g. code) as context for the
AI. You can use globs, e.g. `/load src/**/*.rs`.

Use `/load-url <url>` to load a URL resource. For HTML resources, the command
will try to extract the main content and convert it to markdown.

Instead of `/new`, you can use `/reset` (`/r`) to keep context from `/load`,
`/load-url`, and `/asset-load` while clearing the rest of the conversation.

In a similar vein, any `/pin <message>` is kept around on `/reset`.

### For Python development

When using the `!py` tool, the system python will be used. If a virtualenv
(`.venv`) is available anywhere in the current directory tree, it will be used
instead which makes your custom Python library dependencies available.

For a more modern approach, use `!pyuv` which instructs the AI to specify
script dependencies using
[PEP 723: Inline script dependencies](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/). This
solves most problems related to the AI writing Python with dependencies you
don't have installed on your machine.

### Cost estimation

The prompt shows you the number of tokens in your current conversation. Use
`/cost` to see how much your conversation has cost so far and the input cost of
your next prompt. Useful when you've loaded lots of files for context.

| ‚ö† **Warning** |
|----------------|
| Tokens are always estimated using the GPT-3.5 tokenizer because of its smaller size and therefore faster loading time. Unscientifically, I've seen estimates inaccurate by as much as 20%. |

### Task creation & publishing

Tasks are defined in toml. For example, here's the `ken/strava-api` task defined
in a file on my machine called `strava-api.toml`.

```toml
name = "ken/strava-api"
version = "1.0.0"

description = "Playground for the Strava API"

# Uncomment to require a specific version of hai
#dependencies = [
#    "hai >= 1.16.0"
#]

# Uncomment to hide this task from your /whois profile and search
# unlisted = true

steps = [
    "/load-url https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json",
    "/pin Loaded Strava API's swagger definition.",
    "/pin Next, you'll need an access token from https://www.strava.com/settings/api",
    "/ask-human(secret,cache) What's you're strava access token?",
    """\
/pin When making requests to the Strava API from the shell, use HTTPie (`http`)
with the `--pretty=all` flag. If unavailable, fallback to curl.
""",
    "/pin Because the swagger definition is large, be wary of the cost",
    "/cost",
    "/pin Entering !sh tool mode to make it easier to make API requests",
    "!sh",
]
```

- `name` - This must be your username followed by the name of your task. All
  tasks are namespaced by a username to avoid duplicates and confusion.
- `version` - Must be a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) (semver).
- `description` - Explain what the task is for. Helps for task search.
- `dependencies` - Require the `hai` client to satisfy a semver. Useful if
  the task uses a command that only became available after a certain version.
- `unlisted` - Hides the task from search and your /whois profile.
- `steps` - Every step is something you could have typed yourself into the CLI.
  At the conclusion of the steps, the user takes over with the context fully
  populated.

You can test your task by referencing it by file path. To avoid ambiguity with
tasks in the repo, the file path must begin with `./`, `/`, or `~`:

```
/task ./path/to/strava-api.toml
```

When your task is ready to publish, run:

```
/task-publish ./path/to/strava-api.toml
```

The version must be greater than the latest currently in the repo.

Anyone can run your task by using its `name`:

```
/task ken/strava-api
```

#### Using a task to make a task

To have the AI help you write a task, use:

```
/task hai/quick-task
```

You can discuss with the AI what you want the task to accomplish. When you're
done, save the task definition to a toml file and `/task-publish` it.

If you already have an active conversation with loaded resources (files, URLs,
or assets), you can ask the AI to use the current context as the basis for your
new task. This is especially useful for creating reusable tasks that
automatically load your commonly-used resources.

#### Examples

All published tasks are viewable. You can whois a user (e.g. `/whois ken`), see
what tasks they've published, and view them via
`/task-view <username>/<task_name>`. Or, you can use `/task-search` to find
tasks you're interested in.

#### Task-specific commands

In task mode, `/new` (`/n`) resets the task to the beginning rather than
clearing the entire conversation. To clear, use `/task-end`.

There are some `hai`-repl commands that are specifically made for tasks:

- `/ask-human <prompt>` - Ask the question.
- `/ask-human(secret) <prompt>` - User's answer is treated as a secret and
  hidden.
- `/ask-human(cache) <prompt>` - When a user runs the task again, their
  previous answer is used. `/task-forget` to reset.

- `/set-mask-secrets on` - AI output that includes the secret is masked in the
  terminal.
  - An example use case is asking the user for their API token to a service.
    With masking, the AI can use the token in its tool-invocations and it'll
    show as masked `*******` in the terminal.

- `/exec <cmd>` - Execute a command on the local machine. The user is always
  prompted yes/no.
- `/exec(cache) <cmd>` - When a user runs the task again, the output from
  the previous invocation is used.
  - An example use of `/exec` is to make the first task command
    `/exec(cache) ffmpeg -version` so that the AI knows to tweak its
    `fmpeg` command-line with the exact version in mind.

- `/prompt <message>` - Makes it explicit that the line is prompting the AI.
- `/prompt(cache) <message>` - When a user runs the task again, the AI
  output from the previous invocation is used instead of re-prompting.
  - The cache is useful for avoiding the delay of an AI response and reducing
    costs for expensive prompts.

- `/task-include <name|path>` - Runs the task steps without entering task-mode
  or exiting another task-mode. Useful when you want to use a task even if
  you're in another task-mode. For example, I'll `/task-include
  ken/absolute-mode` while in other tasks.

- `/ai <model>` - While this isn't a task-only command, its behavior is subtly
  different. In a task step, if the user doesn't have hai-router or an API key
  set for the requested model, the current model isn't changed. This means a
  task author can use `/ai <model>` without fearing that a task will try to use
  a model without a key set.

- `/keep <bottom> [<top>]` - Not only for tasks, but this is useful for tasks
  running in a loop that want to forget messages to bound the size of the
  conversation.

- `/pin(danger|warn|info|success)` - Add a message for the AI or user without
  prompting the AI for a response.

### Command-line options

- `hai task <task_name>` - Immediately drops user into task-mode.
- `hai bye '<cmd>'...` - Run any command(s) as if using the CLI without entering
  the CLI. Use single-quotes to minimize issues. Multiple commands can be
  specified. All printouts go to the terminal and `hai` exits at the end.
  - e.g. `hai bye '!sh convert apple1.jpg to webp'`
  - If running in non-interactive mode (e.g. as a cron job), use `-y` to
    confirm all user prompts, `-m` to set the model, and `-u` to set the user
    account.
  - Use `-` as a command to create a `/prep` message with data from stdin.
    e.g. `cat meeting_notes.txt | hai bye - 'summary please'`
- `hai -i` - Enter incognito mode to keep no history. Pair with
  `default_incognito_ai_model` to a local LLM (e.g. ollama) to be fully
  incognito.
- `hai -u <username>` - Force the user account rather than use the
  last active account. Pairs well with `hai task ...` and `hai bye ...` for
  multi-account setups.
- `hai -m <model>` - Force the AI model.
- `hai set-key <provider> <key>` - Set API keys for providers (openai,
  anthropic, deepseek, google, xai). You don't need to do this if you've
  subscribed to hai.

### More config options

See `~/.hai/hai.toml` for all options. Some options to highlight:

- Set `tool_confirm = true` to require your confirmation before executing any
  tool. Use this if you're worried about your AI going rogue.
- By default, `temperature` is set to 0 across all AIs. That's hacker-friendly
  because it works uniformly across providers (minus some reasoning AIs) and
  optimizes for highest likelihood rather than whimsical exploration. Set
  `default_ai_temperature_to_absolute_zero = false` to use the AI providers
  default or specify your own with `/temperature`.
- Set `check_for_updates = false` to disable anonymous version checks when `hai`
  runs. When disabled, `hai` makes no network requests that aren't initiated by
  you.

### Going meta: the AI knows how to use `hai`

If I'm feeling lazy, I'll ask the AI to write the hai-repl commands using the
`!hai` tool.

```
[7]: !hai load silk road wiki. who was the founder?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

- /load-url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)
- /prompt Who was the founder of the Silk Road marketplace?

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Pushed 2 command(s) into queue

---

!hai-tool[0]: /load-url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)
Loaded (markdown): Silk Road (marketplace) (32,696 tokens)
!hai-tool[1]: /prompt Who was the founder of the Silk Road marketplace?

‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

The founder of the Silk Road marketplace was **Ross Ulbricht**, who operated under the pseudonym "Dread Pirate Roberts."
```

The AI is capable enough to know what URL to load and then ask itself a
question about the contents.

#### !hai recursion

Some AIs (`sonnet-3.7` was used below; `gpt-4o` never works) are able to work
out whether they need to re-prompt themselves to act on intermediate
information.

In this example, only the first command is prompted by the user. The rest,
prefixed by `hai-tool[ ]:`, are prompted by the AI. For brevity, user confirmations
are omitted.

```
[0]: !hai get a random number. if it is even, ask the AI how large the sun is. if it is odd, delete `file1.txt`.

‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

- !py Generate a random number and determine if it's even or odd

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
random_number = random.randint(1, 100)

# Check if the number is even or odd
if random_number % 2 == 0:
    result = "even"
else:
    result = "odd"

print(f"The random number is: {random_number}")
print(f"The number is {result}")

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

```

# The Size of the Sun

The Sun is enormously large compared to Earth. Here are the key measurements:

- Sun's diameter: approximately 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles)
- Sun's volume: approximately 1.41 √ó 10^18 cubic kilometers
- Sun's mass: approximately 1.989 √ó 10^30 kilograms
```

### AI-Defined Reusable Functions

A drawback of `!py` is that the AI writes the Python code every time the tool
is used. This potentially consumes a lot of output tokens and the time it takes
to generate them. The waste is apparent when prompting `!py` repeatedly with
different inputs (string, file, ...).

The solution is to use `!fn-py <prompt>` which instructs the AI to generate a
Python function that takes an argument and returns a JSON-compatible result
that is added to the conversation.

```
[0]: !fn-py find the sqrt

‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

def f(arg):
    import math
    return math.sqrt(arg)

‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Stored as command: /f0
```

The new function can be invoked like a command: `/f0 <arg>`. For example:

```
[3]: /f0 64
8.0
```

If you want the AI to generate the call to `/f0`, use the `!hai` tool:

```
[5]: !hai what's the sqrt of pi

‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

- /f0 3.141592653589793


‚öô ‚öô ‚öô

Pushed 1 command(s) into queue

---

!hai-tool[0]: /f0 3.141592653589793
1.7724538509055159
```

For a reusable shell function, use `!fn-sh`. For a resuable python function
that can declare script dependencies, use `!fn-pyuv`.

### More on Assets

#### Metadata

Each asset can have a JSON object associated with it to store metadata:

- `/asset-md-get <name>` - Fetches metadata for an asset and adds it to the
  conversation.
- `/asset-md-set <name> <json>` - Sets the entire metadata blob.
- `/asset-md-set-key <name> <key> <value>` - Sets/replaces a metadata key.
- `/asset-md-del-key <name> <key>` - Delete a metadata key.

If a `title` metadata key is set, it's shown in `/asset-list` and
`/asset-search` in `[]` brackets.

| üôã **Help Wanted** |
|-------------------|
| Interested in using metadata to make asset encryption the default way of life? |
| All ideas welcome. Please reach out or open an issue. |

#### Asset Push & ACL

Your public assets (prefixed by your username `/username/...`) can have ACLs
set so that an asset can be used as a write-only "asset/document drop".

```
/asset-acl /ken/hai-feedback deny:read-data
/asset-acl /ken/hai-feedback allow:push-data
```

With these ACLs, any user can push data (`/asset-push`) into the
`/ken/hai-feedback` asset, but no one except the owner can read what's been
pushed.

The owner (user `ken` in this example) can read the contents of
`/ken/hai-feedback` using `/asset-list-revisions` and can access revisions with
`/asset-get-revision`.

#### Listening for changes

`/asset-listen <name>` can be used to block the REPL until a change to the
asset. You can test this by:

```
# Console 1 (create asset)
/asset test-listen

# Console 2 (listen for changes -- blocking)
/asset-listen test-listen

# Console 1 (modify, unblocking console 2)
/asset test-listen
```

For an example of sending emails based on asset changes, see the
[hai/email-asset-updates](https://hai.superego.ai/task/hai/email-asset-updates@1.0.0)
task: `/task hai/email-asset-updates`

Note that the API exposes a websockets interface that pushes notifications when
changes occur.

### Standard-Library Functions

These functions serve as lightweight commands without crowding the `/<command>`
namespace.


| Function                 | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/std now`               | Displays the current date and time.                             |
| `/std new-day-alert`     | Makes AI aware when a new day begins since the last interaction.|
| `/std which <prog>`      | Checks if a specific program is available.                      |

Using `/std now` is preferable to `/exec date`, as the latter requires user
confirmation to execute in untrusted tasks. The same reasoning applies to
`/std which` instead of `/exec which`.

The `/std new-day-alert` function is essential for ongoing, multi-day
conversations (e.g., calendar tasks). It ensures the AI is aware of a day
change so it can handle relative dates accurately.

### Collapsing Folders

The underlying asset store uses a key-value structure. While asset keys may
contain forward slashes to resemble directory paths, these are purely cosmetic.

By default, when listing your assets, they appear as a flat list:

```
[0] /ls
```
```
a/b/c
a/b/d
a/b/e/f
```

To make browsing easier, you can choose to "collapse" specific folders:

- `/asset-folder-collapse <path>` - Collapse a folder when listing a parent prefix.
- `/asset-folder-expand <path>` - Uncollapse a folder when listing a parent prefix.
  **Note** that all folders are expanded by default.
- `/asset-folder-list [<prefix>]` - List all collapsed folders with the given
  path prefix.

Collapsing the `a/b` folder:

```
[1] /asset-collapse a/b
```

Now, listing the root shows the collapsed folder:

```
[2] /ls
```
```
a/büìÅ
```

To view the contents of the collapsed folder, list it directly:

```
[3] /ls a/b/
```
```
a/b/c
a/b/d
a/b/e/f
```

There's a limit of 100 collapsed folders each for your private and public assets.

### Saving and resuming chats

You can resume your last chat using:

```
/chat-resume
```

Your last chat is saved locally whenever you exit `hai` or start a new
conversation with `/new` or `/reset`.

To save a chat for the long term as an asset, use:

```
/chat-save
```

By default, chats are saved as assets named `chat/<timestamp>`. A descriptive
title is automatically generated and stored in the [asset metadata](#metadata)
for easier discovery. For example:

```
[0] /ls
chat/2025-04-08-203003 [Public/Private Key Management for Encryption and Signing]
```

Resume a named chat:

```
/chat-resume <name>
```

Save with a custom name:

```
/chat-save [<name>]
```

### Sending Emails

You (or the AI) can send emails using `/email` with a multi-line input:

```
/email <subject>
<body>
```

`/email` sends an email to a default address you've verified. Use the
`hai/add-email` task to configure it:

```
[0] /task hai/add-email
...
[1] add x@y.com as an email recipient
[2] verify it with code 'xyzabc'  # from email
```

To have the AI send you an email, you'll need to use the `!hai` tool:

```
!hai send me an email with an uplifting quote of the day
```

### Receiving Commands via WebSockets [Experimental]

`hai` can expose a WebSocket interface, allowing other programs, processes, or
even web services to enqueue commands for execution.

#### 1. Start the Queue Listener

Launch the listener with:

```sh
hai listen -a <address> -w <whitelisted_origin_header>
```

- If `-a` is omitted, the listener defaults to `127.0.0.1:1338`.
- To prevent unauthorized access, use `-w` to whitelist an `Origin` header
  value. Only requests with a matching `Origin` header will be accepted.

> **Note**
> If a request does **not** include an `Origin` header (it does not originate
  from a browser), the whitelist is not enforced and the request is allowed.

#### 2. Enqueue Commands via WebSocket

Connect to the WebSocket and send a JSON payload like:

```json
{
  ".tag": "push",
  "cmds": [
    "/load-url <url-populated-by-requester>",
    "Key takeaways?",
  ]
}
```

- The `cmds` array can contain one or more commands to enqueue.

As long as the `hai listen` process is running, incoming commands will be added
to the queue.

#### 3. Processing the Queue

To process (pop) queued commands, use the `/queue-pop` command from within the
`hai` REPL.

### Open Source

> I don't like running software that I and others can't audit the code of.

The `hai` CLI is available under the Apache 2.0 license. You can freely use it,
modify it, and contribute back.

You can enter a prompt with the source code loaded as context using the
`hai/code` task:

```
[0]: /task hai/code
```
```
hai/code[22]: is hai privacy conscious? does it keep my data safe?
```
```
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

The `hai` CLI takes steps to respect user privacy and provide options for users
to safeguard their information. Here's a detailed analysis based on the code
and documentation:

...
```

### API

To query the API, use the `hai/api` task:

```
/task hai/api
```

You can use this task to ask the AI about available options or to make actual
requests using an API token. You can get an api token with the `hai/get-api-token` task:

```
/task hai/get-api-token
```

If you want to read about the details, use:

```
/task-view hai/api
```

### Security warning

The primary attack vector to defend against is a published task that's crafted
to delete or exfiltrate your data. Be careful when running any task. All
potentially dangerous commands require a "yes/no" confirmation.

Specifically, tasks may `/exec` commands on your machine which can both delete
and exfiltrate data (e.g. make an http request). Tasks may `/load` data that can
then be exfiltrated. Tasks may use a tool (e.g. `!sh` or `!py`) which can delete
and exfiltrate. Tasks may use the `!hai` tool which may generate a list of
commands that can delete and exfiltrate.
